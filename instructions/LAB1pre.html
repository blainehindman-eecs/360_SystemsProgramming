1. OBJECTIVES
   Partition table, fdisk, structures in C, read/write special files

2 Partition Table:

A disk is usually divided into several partitions. The partitions are recorded
in a partition table in the very first sector of the disk, called the Master 
Boot Record (MBR). Each sector is 512 bytes. Inside the MBR, the partition
table begins at the offset 0x1BE. The Partitin Table contains 4 entries, each 16
bytes long as defined in the following C structure.

struct partition {
	unsigned char drive;            /* 0x80 - active */

	unsigned char head;             /* starting head */
	unsigned char sector;           /* starting sector */
	unsigned char cylinder;         /* starting cylinder */

	unsigned char sys_type;         /* partition type */

	unsigned char end_head;         /* end head */
	unsigned char end_sector;       /* end sector */
	unsigned char end_cylinder;     /* end cylinder */

	unsigned long start_sector;     /* starting sector counting from 0 */
	unsigned long nr_sectors;       /* nr of sectors in partition */
};

As can be seen, sector and cylinder are all unsiged chars (8 bits). However, the
cylinder value is actually 10 bits. The highest 2 bits of cylinder value are in 
the leftmost 2 bits of sector, which is only 6 bits.
 
Each partition has a type, which indicates the kind of file system of the 
partition. Consult Linux fdisk's L command to see the partition types.

If a partition is EXTEND type (type=5), the partition may be further divided 
into more partitions. The extended partitions forms a link-list. 

Assume P4 is EXT type:
P4's beginSector = MBR
                    P5's beginSector
                    P6's MBR's sector# = MBR
                         (r.e. to P4)     P6's begin sector#
                                          P7's MBR r.e. to P4 --> etc.

In the extended partitions, all the sector numbers are RELATIVE to the 
beginSector of the extend partition.

The first sector of each extended partition is a local MBR. Each local MBR also
has a partition table at the offset 0x1BE. It contains only 2 entries. The first
entry defines that extended partition, and the second entry points to the MBR of
the next extended partition. As usual, the link list ends with a 0 pointer.
  
Since use fdisk on a hard disk is very risky, we shall use a VIRTUAL disk for 
this assignment. A VIRTUAL disk is a file whose contents are exactly the same as
that of a REAL disk. Download the file ~cs360/samples/LAB1/vdisk to Linux. Use 
it as a VIRTUAL disk and run Linux's fdisk on it, as in
                fdisk vdisk
Under fdisk, enter 
                'p' : to print the partition table
                'q' : to quit fdisk

                      REQUIREMENTS

Write a C progrom to display the partition table of vdisk in 
(1). RAW form, i.e. as per the partiton struct entries (%20), then 
(2). Linux fdisk 'p' output form (%40),
(3). ALL the extend partitions (%40) <== YOU BETTER DO THIS !!!!.

Turn in a hard copy of your program.

3. HELP INFO: UNIX System calls for reading/writing files
              int fd =  open("filename", mode);
                       lseek(fd, (long)position, 0); 
              int n  =  read(fd, buffer, nbytes);
              int n  = write(fd, buffer, nbytes);
                       close(fd);

The following C program reads disk sectors

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt
#include &lt;string.h&gt
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt

char buf[512];
int sector;

main()
{
   int fd, r;
   sector = 10;                           // sector # 10 (count from 0)

   fd = open("vdisk", O_WRONLY);          // USE A VIRTUAL DISK image file
   strcpy(buf, "cs360 is fun");           // create a string in buf[]
   lseek(fd, (long)sector*512, 0);        // seek to the sector 10
   r = write(fd, buf, 512);               // write 512 bytes to fd
   printf("r=%d bytes written\n", r);     // show number of bytes written
   close(fd);                             // close the file descriptor fd

   fd = open("vdisk", O_RDONLY);          // open disk iamge file for READ
   lseek(fd, (long)sector*512, 0);        // seek to sector 10           
   r = read(fd, buf, 512);                // read 512 bytes into buf
   printf("r=%d read  buf=%s\n", r, buf); // show result
   close(fd);                             // close opened file
}
