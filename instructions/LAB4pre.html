             CS360 Lab Assignment #4 Pre-work
             DUE: 10-1-2014: DEMO PART 1 to TA

================= PART 1: CGI PROGRAMMING: ==============================

1. YOUR WEBSITE at cs360.eecs.wsu.edu
   Each of you has a user account on the Linux machine cs360.eecs.wsu.edu
        login name = YOUR email name before @ (with any . replaced with _)
        password   = YOUR WSU ID number

2. Access YOUR website by

        http://cs360.eecs.wsu.edu/~YOUR_NAME
       
        ------------------------------------
        |    Welcome to YOUR Website       |
        |       ------------------         |
        |       | YOUR PICTURE   |         |
        |       ------------------         |
        | Input command  :  BOX            | 
        | Input filename1:  BOX            |
        | Input filename2:  BOX            | 
        | Submit command :  Submit BOX     |
        ------------------------------------

3. You will NOT like your current picture. 
   REQUIRED WORK: login to your account by
                  ssh YOUR_NAME@cs360.eecs.wsu.edu
                  Change it to YOUR pretty picture.

4. When you click the Submit BOX, it submits the strings you entered to the
   httpd (Apache) server on the cs360.eecs.wsu.edu machine, directing it to 
   execute
             ~kcw/cgi-bin/mycgi 
 
  which echos YOUR inputs and shows another input-submit window again.

5. login to your account. As of now, YOUR home directory contains:
 
        public_html --- index.html 
               |
            cgi-bin ---- mycgi.c util.o

5-1. Modify YOUR public_html/index.html file: CHANGE the line

< FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://cs360.eecs.wsu.edu/~kcw/cgi-bin/mycgi" >  TO

< FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://cs360.eecs.wsu.edu/~YOURname/cgi-bin/mycgi" >

5-2. Go to YOUR cgi-bin/ directory. Change the line in mycgi.c file

 printf("&lt;FORM METHOD=\"POST\" ACTION=\"http://cs360.eecs.wsu.edu/~kcw/cgi-bin/mycgi\">"); TO

 printf("&lt;FORM METHOD=\"POST\" ACTION=\"http://cs360.eecs.wsu.edu/~YOURname/cgi-bin/mycgi\">");

Then run   cc -o mycgi mycgi.c util.o   # generate YOUR OWN mycgi executable.
           chmod u+s mycgi              # chmod mycgi to a SETUID executable

6. Access YOUR webpage again. Enter command and filenames. Then, Submit.
   It should execute YOUR mycgi program in YOUR cgi-bin/ directory.

======================= THEN, DO THESE: ===================================================
7. MODIFY mycgi.c to do the following commands:

     mkdir dirname
     rmdir dirname
     rm    filename

     cat   filename
     cp    file1 file2
     ls    [directory] <== if no directory, ls CWD

NOTE: YOUR mycgi program is executed by an Apache process (uid=80). In order for
      the Apache process to write to YOUR directories, you MUST change YOUR 
      mycgi to a setuid program by
            chmod u+s mycgi
When a process executes a setuid program, it temporarily assumes the uid of the
program owner, allowing it to write to the owner's directories.


========================== PART 2  ====================================

1. Download the server.c and client.c files from ~samples/LAB4.
   cc and run the programs. Modify the programs to do the following:

          client: sends 2 numbers to server, 
          server: returns the SUM of the 2 numbers.

2. Write a C program, mystat, which runs as 
                      mystat filename
   and prints the following information of filename:

   (1). General infor: 

         File_type     Permissions    Uid    Size     Creation Time
       ------------   -------------   ----  -------  ----------------
       [REG|DIR|LNK]   rwx r-x r--   (uid)   (u32)   (calendar form)

   (2). If filename is a LNK, print  filename -> linked_name_string.

   (3). If filename is a DIR, print the file names in the DIR.


2. HELP INFO:
   Use the stat system call to get file information (from Kernel):
      
       #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

       int  stat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf);
       int lstat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf);

   #typedef unsigned short u16;
   #typedef unsigned long  u32;
     
   Both stat() and lstat() return the information of filename in a stat struct

            struct stat {
                u16        st_dev;      /* device */
                u32        st_ino;      /* inode */
                u16        st_mode;     /* protection */
                u16        st_nlink;    /* number of hard links */
                u16        st_uid;      /* user ID of owner */
                u16        st_gid;      /* group ID of owner */
                u16        st_rdev;     /* device type (if inode device) */
                u32        st_size;     /* total size, in bytes */
                u32        st_blksize;  /* blocksize for filesystem I/O */
                u32        st_blocks;   /* number of blocks allocated */
                u32        st_atime;    /* time of last access */
                u32        st_mtime;    /* time of last modification */
                u32        st_ctime;    /* time of last change */
            };

  
      stat() FOLLOWs the link (to the actual file) if filename is a SYMLINK 
     lstat() does NOT follow the link, so it works for SYMLINK files.

  In the stat struct, the st_mode field is a u16 (2 bytes) containing
     
       |Type|   |permissions|
       ----------------------
       |tttt|fff|uuu|ggg|ooo| 
       ----------------------

    The leading 4 bits represent file types. For example:
          4      st_mode
         bits    (Octal)         Type
        ------   =======  ==================
         1000    0100000   REG: regular file
         0100    0040000   DIR: directory
         1010    0120000   LNK: symbolic link
        ------   ======= 
    The next 3 bits are flag bits, which indicate special usage of the file 

    The remaining 9 bits are PERMISSION bits for file protection:

        owner  group  other
         rwx    rwx    rwx
    
    The bits can be tested by a technique known as BIT-MASKing:
        if ( (  item  & (1 << j)  } ==> test the j_th bit (from LOW) of item   
    Examples:
        if ( (st_mode & (1 << 8)) ) ==> Owner can r
        if ( (st_mode & (1 << 7)) ) ==> Owner can w
        if ( (st_mode & (1 << 6)) ) ==> Owner can x
    Simliarly,
        if ( (st_mode & 0100000) == 0100000) ==> REG 
        if ( (st_mode & 0040000) == 0040000) ==> DIR
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In all Unix systems, ctime, atime, mtime are seconds since Jan 1, 1970.    
    The library function char *ctime(&ctime) return a string in calendar form.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
2-2. The system call   int readlink(char *filename, char *buf, int bufsize);
     reads the contents of a LNK into buf[bufsize] and returns the number of
     chars read.

2-3. With  #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;   the system calls

           DIR *dp = opendir("dirname");      opens a DIR (for R/W), and

           struct dirent *ep = readdir(dp);   returns ep pointing at the
                                              next entry of an opened DIR 

           The dirent structure is declared as follows:

           struct dirent
           {
             u32   d_ino;                /* inode number */
             u32   d_off;                /* offset to this dirent */
             u16   d_reclen;             /* length of this d_name */
             char  d_name [NAME_MAX+1];  /* file name (null-terminated) */
          }
     
      All you need is the d_name field.

HAVE FUN !!
