Simply create a virtual disk:

	touch mydisk          # create a file named mydisk
    	mke2fs mydisk 1440    # format mydisk as an EXT2 FS


You can add content by mounting:

	mount -o loop mydisk /mnt
	mkdir /mnt/newDir
	touch /mnt/newDir/newFile

Then unmount:

	unmount /mnt

Now what was added is saved within mydisk.

Run showblock.bin in the form:
	
	./showblock.bin mydisk newDir
